This is my very first website, in the beginning of my senior year in highschool I joined a web design class and decided I wanted to make my very own website, sorry if the html and css are naive, it is my very first website eve created on my own. I used various other websites to figure out certain things I wanted to use, being a new coder, I wanted to get inspiration from something else.
